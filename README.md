## What it Does
__semantic-release-cli performs the following steps:__

1. Asks for the information it needs. You will need to provide it with:
	* Whether your GitHub repository is public or private
	* Which npm registry you want to use (Default: https://registry.npmjs.org/)
	* Your npm username (unless passwords were previously saved to keychain)
	* Your npm email
	* Your npm password
	* Your GitHub username
	* Your GitHub password (unless passwords were previously saved to keychain)
	* Which continuous integration system you want to use. (Options: Travis CI / Pro / Enterprise / CircleCI, or Other)
	* [Travis only] Whether you want to test a single node.js version (e.g. - 8) or multiple node.js versions (e.g. - 4, 6, 8, etc.)
1. Save your passwords to your local OS's keychain using [keytar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar) for future use (unless `--no-keychain` was specified)
1. npm Add User
	* Runs `npm adduser` with the npm information provided to generate a `.npmrc`
	* Parses the npm token from the `.npmrc` for future use
1. Create GitHub Personal Token
	* Logs into GitHub using the username and password provided
	* Creates (and saves for later use) a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the following permissions: *repo, read:org, repo:status, repo_deployment, user:email, write:repo_hook*
1. Update your `package.json`
	* Set `version` field to `0.0.0-development` (`semantic-release` will set the version for you automatically)
	* Add a `semantic-release` script: `"semantic-release": "semantic-release"`
	* Add `semantic-release` as a `devDependency`
	* Add or overwrite the [`repository` field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#repository)

## Travis CI
For Travis CI, `semantic-release-cli` performs the following additional steps:
1. Overwrite your `.travis.yml` file
	* `after_success`: `npm install -g travis-deploy-once` and `travis-deploy-once "npm run semantic-release"`: run `semantic-release` exactly once after all builds pass
	* Set other sane defaults: `cache: directories: ~/.npm`, `notifications: email: false`
1. Login to Travis CI to configure the package
	* Enable builds of your repo
	* Add `GH_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` environment variables in the settings

## CircleCI

For CircleCI, `semantic-release-cli` performs the following additional steps:
1. Create minimal `config.yml` file (if CircleCI was selected)
```yml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: 'circleci/node:latest'
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
        name: install
        command: npm install
      - run:
        name: release
        command: npm run semantic-release || true
```
2. Login to CircleCI to configure the package
	* Enable builds of your repo
	* Add `GH_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` environment variables in the settings

## Other CI Servers

By default, `semantic-release-cli` supports the popular Travis CI and CircleCI servers. If you select `Other` as your server during configuration, `semantic-release-cli` will print out the environment variables you need to set on your CI server. You will be responsible for adding these environment variables as well as configuring your CI server to run `npm run semantic-release` after all the builds pass.

Note that your CI server will also need to set the environment variable `CI=true` so that `semantic-release` will not perform a dry run. (Most CI services do this by default.) See the `semantic-release` documentation for more details.

## Setting defaults

This package reads your npm username from your global `.npmrc`. In order to autosuggest a username in the future, make sure to set your username there: `npm config set username <username>`.

It also reads your GitHub username from your global `.gitconfig`. In order to autosuggest a username in the future, run `git config --global --add github.username <username>`. If a name isn't defined here, it will default to using your npm username, as it will assume they are identical.
